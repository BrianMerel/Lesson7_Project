What is a Content Delivery Network (CDN)?  List and explain at least FOUR advantages in using a CDN.

A CDN is a content delivery system. They are a system of distributed servers (network) that deliver webpages and other web content
to a user based on the geographic locations of the user, the origin of the webpage and a content delivery servery.

Benefits:
    -Regardless of the location of your main webserver, users across the world will be able to access your files. Also likely more quickly.
       CDN's often have localized data centers, that are closer and provide faster downloads.
    
    -CDN's are distributed, offer redundancy and are scalable to a large number of connetions.
    
    -When using a CDN you can offload system resources and bandwidth from your server to the CDN. This can boost performance and reduce your
    existing hosting costs.
    
    -Browsers limit the number of concurrent connections to a single domain, usually about 4. CDN files are hosted on a different domain and allows
    the browser a futher four files at the same time.
